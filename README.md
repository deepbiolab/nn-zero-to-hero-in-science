# Protein Language Modeling from Zero to Hero

This repository is a hands-on, step-by-step tutorial series inspired by Andrej Karpathyâ€™s "nn zero to hero" philosophy, tailored for the protein language modeling domain.

## ðŸš€ What is this project?

This project walks you through building protein language models from scratch â€” starting from the simplest bigram model, all the way to advanced transformer architectures.  
Along the way, youâ€™ll learn how to apply reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to fine-tune these models for protein-specific tasks.

## ðŸ“– Stay Tuned!

This series is under active development.  
Follow the repository, and join the journey from zero to hero in protein language modeling!
